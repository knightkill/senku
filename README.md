# Mermaid Diagram Generator

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that generates Mermaid diagrams from text descriptions using AI-powered language models.

## What it does

1. Accepts a task or process name from the user.
2. Generates or allows manual input of a detailed text description of the process.
3. Uses OpenAI's language models to convert the text description into Mermaid diagram code.
4. Renders the Mermaid diagram code as an image using Mermaid CLI.
5. Displays both the Mermaid code and the generated diagram image to the user.

## Key Features

- AI-powered text-to-diagram conversion
- Support for various Mermaid diagram types (flowchart, sequence, class, etc.)
- Option to improve the text description using AI
- Real-time diagram generation and visualization
- Dark-themed diagram output

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Langchain
- OpenAI's GPT models
- Mermaid CLI

This tool is particularly useful for quickly visualizing complex processes, workflows, or systems without the need for manual diagram creation.
